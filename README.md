# Expense Balancer

This is a program that allows users to split expenses with friends or colleagues. If a group needs to share the cost of a particular bill, the Cash Flow Minimiser will make sure that each person who paid money, gets reimbursed with the correct amount. This is also done using the minimum number of transactions.
